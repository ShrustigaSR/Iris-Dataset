# Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization
This project explores the famous Iris dataset, which consists of measurements of sepals and petals of three different species of Iris flowers. The goal is to analyze and visualize the data using various Python libraries.



## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Data Exploration
The Dealing_with_DataFrame.ipynb script reads the Iris dataset from a CSV file and uses the pandas library to explore and analyze the data. The script performs the following data exploration tasks:

- Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
- Checking the data types of each column
- Calculating basic statistics of each column, such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values

## Plots
The script generates various types of plots using different Python plotting libraries, including:

- Histograms and density plots using matplotlib and seaborn
- Scatter plots using matplotlib and seaborn
- Box plots using matplotlib and seaborn
